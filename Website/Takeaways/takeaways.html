					<p>Chippys are known for their casual and laid-back atmosphere, often offering a simple and unpretentious dining experience.

					<p>In addition to fish and chips, chippys may also offer other fried seafood such as scampi, fishcakes, and battered sausages, as well as side dishes like mushy peas, pickled onions, and coleslaw. Some chippys may also have additional menu items like burgers, pies, or chicken, although fish and chips remain the main highlight.</p>

					<p>Chippys are often seen as an affordable and comforting comfort food option, popular for takeout meals or quick dine-in options. They are typically found in coastal towns, cities, and other regions with a strong British or Irish culinary influence.
